# Deployment Instructions for GitHub Pages

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application to GitHub Pages, ensure you have the following:

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/team-health.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd team-health
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build the Project**: Build the project using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Deploy the project to GitHub Pages using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

6. **Configure GitHub Pages**: Go to the repository settings on GitHub, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and select the `gh-pages` branch as the source.

7. **Update Base URL**: Ensure that the `<base href="/team-health/">` tag is present in the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file.

8. **Update Webpack Configuration**: Make sure the `publicPath` in the `output` section of your `webpack.config.js` is set to `/team-health/`.

## Testing the Deployment

After deploying the application, visit the live application URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/team-health/`) to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- **Check Build Logs**: Review the build logs for any errors or warnings.
- **Verify GitHub Pages Settings**: Ensure that the `gh-pages` branch is correctly set as the source in the GitHub Pages settings.
- **Update Dependencies**: Ensure that all project dependencies are up to date by running `npm update`.
- **Clear Cache**: Clear your browser cache and refresh the page to see the latest changes.
